# num = 10
# while num > 6:
#    print(num)
#    num = num-1
# else:
#    print("loop is finished")


# Students do: print the first 5 numbers in 5 separate lines using a while loop by
# incrementing the variable. When the variable is 6,
# use else statement to print(“6 is not the number we want”)

# x = 1
# while x < 6:
#     print(x)
#     x += 1
# else:
#     print("6 is not the number we want")










# FLIS Introduction to loops


# 2. Examples of while loops:
    # 2.1 Simple while loop that will print the numbers from 1 to 10
    # 2.2 Infinite while loop
    # 2.3 while loop that prints every second number from 0 to 10
    # 2.4 ask the students: how would we print every third number from 5 to 20, if x = 5?
    # 2.5 demo of break statement - ask the user to keep entering names. If he enters the name which is "Robocop", then you will
    #     print the message "mission successfull, game over"
    # 2.6 demo of continue statement - write a program that will print every second number from 0-20, but if that number is 8, the program skips that number 8,
    #     and continues printing other numbers up till 20 (10, 12, 14...,20)
    
    
# 3. For loops
#    3.1 first explain what is a range function, and show steps in a range function
#    3.2 explain when to use for and when to use while loop - powerpoint slides 11 and 12
#    3.3 brief introduction to lists
#    3.4 use for loop to print the elements of a list,
#        and if the element of the list is equal to some element of the list, you don't print it
#        and continue printing the remaining elements of the list


# 4. Exercises
# find 2 ways to print an infinite while loop
# print a triangle that has one right angle using a for loop. It needs to be consisted of stars - the * symbol
# runing total: take some number

# print these squares using a for loop.
# *

# x = 1
# while x < 5:
#     if x == 3:
#         print("hohoho")
#     else:
#         print("ppppppp")
#     print(x)
#     x = x + 1    # incrementation = increase
# print("asknasjfn")




# i = 0
# while True:
#     i = i + 1
#     if i == 2:
#         print("Skipping 2")
#         continue
#     if i == 5:
#         print("Breaking")
#         break
#     print(i)
#     
# print("Finished")
# print("asdsad")


# Nested While loops
# i = 1
# j = 5
# while i < 4:
#     while j < 8:
#         print(i, ",", j)
#         j = j + 1
#         i = i + 1






















# 5. Projects:
# Build a calculator
# Guess my secret number in 6 tries  - explain the random module first - also explains why do we need loops

# total = 0
# for i in range(10, 31, 5):
#     calories = 4.2 * i
#     total += calories
#     print(total)
# print("I consumed", total, " calories")
# 
# 
# for i in range(10, 31, 5):
#     calories = 4.2 * i
#     print(calories)
#     print(i)
# print(i)
# print("I consumed", total, " calories")
