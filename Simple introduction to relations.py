# Grade 8 and 7 - Simple introduction to relations

# Remember the inclusive numbers in Math? Hollow and solid circle on the number line
# What is the opposite of less?
# what is the opposite of bigger?
# What is the opposite of equal?

# Discrete Mathematics book
# Test it with variables, declare variables a, b, and c. For example a = 3, b = 5, c = 9
# Converse
# The relations ≤ and ≥ are each other's converse, meaning that for any real numbers a and b:
# a ≤ b and b ≥ a are equivalent.



# Transitivity
# The transitive property of inequality states that for any real numbers a, b, c
# If a ≤ b and b ≤ c, then a ≤ c.


# If either of the premises is a strict inequality, then the conclusion is a strict inequality:
# If a ≤ b and b < c, then a < c.
# If a < b and b ≤ c, then a < c.

# if a ≤ b and b ≤ a, then a = b (antisymmetry)


# Addition and Subtraction
# If a ≤ b, then a + c ≤ b + c and a − c ≤ b − c.
# In other words, the inequality relation is preserved under addition (or subtraction), under multiplication and division






# Using Cindy's example, how can we rewrite the relationships here?
# Ppl=int(input("number of ppl"))
# if Ppl<5:
#     print("i will go by myself")
# elif 4 < Ppl <11:      # or    5 <= Ppl <= 10     or   5 <= Ppl < 11   or  10 >= Ppl >= 5  or 11 > Ppl >= 5
#     print("i will need batman to help me")
# else:
#     print("i will let batman hanadle this")
